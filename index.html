                    <h3>What is the most eaten fish in the UK for the last 10 years?</h3>
                    <p>Known as 'the Big Five', the most widely consumed fish in this country are cod, salmon, haddock,
                        tuna and prawns.UK consumers prefer cod and haddock. We eat these fish more than any other
                        nation.
                        This is the fish
                        served most often in our fish & chip shops. Most of this comes from the Icelandic, Norwegian and
                        Barents Seas, where around one twelfth of the total is caught by the British trawler Kirkella.

                    <h3>Who is the richest fishermen in the World?</h3>
                    <p> The richest professional fisherman of all time is Kevin VanDam. He began his career with
                        B.A.S.S.
                        in 1987 and has won many competitions and titles since, including the Bassmaster Classic, Angler
                        of the Year, and the Forrest Wood Cup. He is the all-time money winner in professional bass
                        fishing,
                        having earned $7,089,388 through August 2022 according to Major League Fishing.
                        VanDam recently announced his intention to retire from tournament fishing at the end of the 2023
                        Bass Pro Tour season.

                    <p>
                        There are two species of weever fish, lesser and great. And they are some of the only venomous
                        fish
                        in UK waters. They spend most of their lives buried in the sand, but when disturbed, they shoot
                        up
                        their black dorsal fin in defence, injecting a painful venom into unsuspecting victims!

                    <p>Defra will not carry out any further investigations into the cause of shellfish deaths in the
                        North East of England, and there is ‘no question’ of the government offering any financial
                        support or compensation to fishermen in the region, reports Tim Oliver.

                    <h3>How is the UK fishing industry doing the last 30 years?</h3>
                    <p>Even the industry's own lobby groups admit that it is a very small industry – in 2021 it made up
                        0.03% of the British economy or less than 1/33rd of 1%. Fishing directly employs around 11,000
                        people – although 18,000 more work in processing – and that number has halved in the last 30
                        years.
