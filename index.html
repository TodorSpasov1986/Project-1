                    <p>Defra will not carry out any further investigations into the cause of shellfish deaths in the
                        North East of England, and there is ‘no question’ of the government offering any financial
                        support or compensation to fishermen in the region, reports Tim Oliver.

                    <h2>How is the UK fishing industry doing?</h2>
                    <p>Even the industry's own lobby groups admit that it is a very small industry – in 2021 it made up
                        0.03% of the British economy or less than 1/33rd of 1%. Fishing directly employs around 11,000
                        people – although 18,000 more work in processing – and that number has halved in the last 30
                        years.
