                <h2>Pearl Lake Country Holiday Park</h2>
                <p> Pearl Lake is a 5 Star caravan holiday park in Herefordshire - near to the historic
                     Welsh border. The sense of peace and beauty is guaranteed during your holiday here,
                      but Pearl Lake also offers so many choices. Perhaps take a woodland walk or try your
                       hand at fishing on the lake. Maybe test your swing with 9 holes of golf before 
                       a little light lunch at the Lakeside bar and bistro. On the other hand, you may 
                       just prefer to soak in the tranquillity of this haven in the country. Decisions, 
                       decisions... </p>

                <h2>Westfield Fishery - Carp Fishing Lake</h2>
                <p> Westfield Fishery is situated in the picturesque village of Medmenham which is located 
                    half way between Marlow in Buckinghamshire and Henley on Thames in Oxfordshire. The carp
                    fishing lake was formed following gravel extraction and is located on a private estate,
                    offering a peaceful and tranquil setting that can be enjoyed all year round.
                    Here at Westfield Fishery we have both a 3 acre carp fishing lake and ½ mile 
                    long coarse stream, both offering a range of different types of fish to catch. 
                    Both the lake and the stream are well stocked, with the carp lake offering a great 
                    selection of common carp and mirror carp (6 over 30lb’s and in excess of 38 lbs) plus 
                    crucian carp and a selection of large tench, bream and pike.

                <h2>The River Dove and the Peak District</h2>
                <p> A legendary fishing spot since Izaak Walton’s The Compleat Angler was 
                    published in 1653; the Dove runs for 40 miles through spectacular Peak
                    District hills and dales. It rises on Axe Edge near Buxton and meets the
                    mighty Trent just north of Burton. The river is popular with fly anglers,
                    offering high-quality trout and grayling. Coarse anglers will also enjoy 
                    plentiful chub and barbel as well as roach, bream, and pike.</p>

                <h2>Windermere and the Lake District</h2>
                <p> Windermere, England’s biggest lake, is home to pike, perch, eels and other
                     coarse favourites. The game fishing is just as appealing, with rare arctic
                      charr and brown trout in abundance. Best of all, salmon and sea trout 
                      migrate through the lake in the spring. Other nearby lakes are just as 
                      tempting, with twenty-pound pike frequently taken from Grasmere and Rydal 
                      Water. </p>
