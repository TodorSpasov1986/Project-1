                <h2>Pearl Lake Country Holiday Park</h2>
                <p> Pearl Lake is a 5 Star caravan holiday park in Herefordshire - near to the historic
                     Welsh border. The sense of peace and beauty is guaranteed during your holiday here,
                      but Pearl Lake also offers so many choices. Perhaps take a woodland walk or try your
                       hand at fishing on the lake. Maybe test your swing with 9 holes of golf before 
                       a little light lunch at the Lakeside bar and bistro. On the other hand, you may 
                       just prefer to soak in the tranquillity of this haven in the country. Decisions, 
                       decisions... </p>
