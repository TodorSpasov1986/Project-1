-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are rgba(134, 166, 235, 0.6) and rgb(54, 53, 53).
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Anton font is the main font used throughout the whole website with some Labrada in the cover text and Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Anton is a reworking of a traditional advertising sans serif typeface. The letter forms have been digitised and then reshaped for use as a webfont.

    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large, background image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. The most of the sites background is from different eyes catching photos. On the places page, it has images for the top 5 locations as well. The gallery is created from 14 pictures of different fishing catches from the top  places in UK.
